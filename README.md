# WireFrame iOS

## Overview

This is a sample app that solves the problem with wanting to express or share simple app design. It is to replace the boring ole napkin that you sketch on at a bar.

## Why

I was wanting to express a design and the best way for me to do with was visually! I am no artist but this was able to help me communicate with designers and other developers in a quick and easy fashion.

## What's Inside

This Project contains the use of a Coredata, Light MVVM Design Pattern, Custom Drawing Framework, and a handful of other features.

## What's Next?

- Add Screen shots to this repo and update the details
- Better Drawing Mechanics 
- More Apple System Control Layouts
- Tracing of App Screen Shots 
- Stiching together screen shots
- ETC (will keep adding)
